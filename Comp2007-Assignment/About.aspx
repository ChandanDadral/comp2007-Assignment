                <p class="about-info"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right about-char">  S</i>ince our humble beginnings in 2005 with a small space in Toronto’s trendy Yorkville district, Chilli Flakes's growth has been inspired with the passion to cook and serve healthy, Indian-inspired takeout cuisine. 
                    Unlike other Indian restaurants, Chilli Flakes was created with the specific intention to be different. 
                    We know many people love Indian food, but many of them dislike or are unaware of the commonly unhealthy ingredients that make typical 
                    Indian food taste so good. Our menu features items that use the healthy and aromatic spices, but leaves out the fattening ghee, butter, oil, and heavy cream.

Our team takes pride in the fact that we can provide our new and loyal customers with great tasting Indian-inspired 
                    food that is unlike that at any other Indian restaurant you frequent. We recognize that some people are still looking for the typical Indian food, and that's fine with us. Our disclaimer is that if you're expecting heavy, oily, 
                    unhealthy Indian food, then Chilli Flakes is NOT the place for you. Our hope is that you'll join the growing trend that so many others have already discovered and you will try Flake's as a unique alternative not just to other Indian restaurants,
                     but to all other healthy food options out there!
